# Pay402 Project Rules

## Anti-Bloat: DO NOT CREATE ANALYSIS DOCUMENTS

**CRITICAL RULE:** When the user asks for analysis or cleanup:
1. ✅ DO the work directly
2. ✅ Commit with detailed message
3. ❌ DO NOT create analysis documents (ANTI_BLOAT_ANALYSIS.md, etc.)
4. ❌ DO NOT create audit documents (DOCUMENTATION_AUDIT.md, etc.)
5. ❌ DO NOT create plan documents (CLEANUP_PLAN.md, etc.)

**Why:** Analysis documents ARE bloat. Git commit messages preserve reasoning.

**Example - WRONG:**
```
User: "Check docs for bloat"
AI: Creates ANTI_BLOAT_ANALYSIS.md (10 KB) ← THIS IS BLOAT!
```

**Example - CORRECT:**
```
User: "Check docs for bloat"
AI: Deletes bloated files, commits with message explaining what and why
```

## Commit Messages Are Documentation

Use detailed commit messages instead of creating markdown files:
- Explain WHAT changed
- Explain WHY it changed
- List specific files/impacts
- Include metrics (KB saved, files deleted)

**Good commit message > Markdown analysis document**

## When Analysis IS Needed

If deep analysis is truly required:
1. Present findings in chat response (user sees immediately)
2. Execute changes based on findings
3. DO NOT save analysis to file unless explicitly requested
4. If saved, DELETE after user confirms they've read it

## File Creation Rules

**Only create files that:**
- ✅ Are code/configuration
- ✅ Are permanent documentation (README, guides)
- ✅ User explicitly requested

**Never create files that:**
- ❌ Analyze other files (audit docs)
- ❌ Plan work (planning docs)
- ❌ Track progress (status docs)
- ❌ Summarize work done (summary docs)

Use git log for history. Use commit messages for reasoning.
